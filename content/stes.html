<h1>Support Subscriptions</h1>

<p>The <emph>Standard</emph> and <emph>Premium</emph> Enterprise Support
    subscriptions are sold as annual subscriptions. The Standard subscription
    provides support suitable for all commercial Syncthing users, where longer
    service level agreements (SLAs) are acceptable and hot fixes for production
    deployments are not required. The Premium subscription is suitable whenever
    priority case handling is required. It includes faster response times,
    expedited solutions, phone support for critical production issues, and
    access to custom feature development.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked
    Questions</h2>

<ul>
    <li><i>Which versions of Syncthing are supported?</i>
        <p>We generally advise users to run the most recent version of
            Syncthing as it is the most up to date and secure. We proactively
            notify all subscribers when important updates are available. We
            provide technical support for the current release, and any release
            issued within one year of the current release.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>How do I create a support ticket?</i>
        <p>To create a support ticket, please use the email addresses in
            your support contract to send and receive support case information.
            You can also use the support portal to create and follow up on
            support tickets. If you have a Premium support subscription, you can
            get support by phone for critical issues.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>What SLA can Kastelo guarantee?</i>
        <p>For Premium support customers, Kastelo guarantees an SLA of two
            hours for the initial contact in new support queries. We will offer
            service credits in the event that we fail to meet this
            expectation.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>How is the open source Syncthing supported?</i>
        <p>Kastelo supports binary builds of the open source Syncthing that
            are obtained from the official GitHub releases page and the
            Syncthing APT repository (apt.syncthing.net). Purchase a Standard or
            Premium support subscription for each Syncthing device that requires
            support. Kastelo does not support binaries that you build from
            source yourself, or binary distributions obtained from other
            sources.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>What happens when my support expires?</i>
        <p>After your support contract expires you are no longer eligible to
            obtain support from Kastelo. Access to the Kastelo support portal
            will be revoked. However, your ability to continue to use Syncthing
            is not affected in any way.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>How many of my devices do I need to have under support?</i>
        <p>Each Syncthing device used as part of the deployment where
            support is required must be covered by the support subscription.
            Support may be withheld if it is discovered that a significant part
            of the deployment is not covered by the subscription. There may be
            other deployments, used for a different purpose, which are not
            covered by support.</p>
    </li>

    <li><i>How can I get design or consultancy help?</i>
        <p>If you need help with architecture, design, or configuration, we
            can help you translate your requirements into an optimized Syncthing
            deployment. Please <a href="mailto:info@kastelo.net">contact us</a>
            to learn more.</p>
