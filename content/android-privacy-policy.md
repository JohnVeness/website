# Syncthing-Android Privacy Policy

Read this document to understand how the app Syncthing-Android uses data.

---

Syncthing-Android does not collect any user information.

The app does not store any location data.
The location permission to access location in the background is used only to check for an SSID of the currently active Wi-Fi.
The sole purpose of this information is to limit synchronisation to user-configured Wi-Fi connections.
The app itself never collects the location in the process, and as such it also does not use or save any location data.

The camera permission is used solely to scan QR codes in order to provide an easy method for entering device IDs.
The app does not save any actual pictures or video in the process.

Syncthing-Android runs Syncthing, which may collect anonymous usage data related to the usage of the application.
In order for this to happen, the user is required to either consciously opt in or use beta/candidate builds.
Specific information on the anonymous usage reporting is available under https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html.
